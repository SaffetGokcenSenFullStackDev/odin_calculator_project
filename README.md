# Odin Calculator Project

In this project, a calculator is created using html, css and javascript. The entered expression is calculated respecting the operator precedence. The calculator does not admit the user to enter mathematically nonsense combinations of operators, numbers, decimal separators and equal sign. Once the equal sign is pressed, the result is displayed. In this case, the clear button must be pressed to reset the calculator or the calculator page can be refreshed for the reset.
